### Results 
#### Theater Outcome Based on Launch Date 
Overall, there were more successful theater outcomes than failed or canceled. 
The month of May had both the most successful and the most failed outcomes, 111 and 52, respectively. 
Thearter campaigns in December were the least successful, and we had the most canceled in January. 
#### Outcomes Based on Gaols
Outcomes, more specifically, percentage successful and failed, had an inversely propotional relationship with the goals. This was primarily because there were no canceled campaigns. The least successful campaign was the most failed campaign. 
#### Limitations of the Dataset
A few outliers where in the dataset. It caused a huge discrepancy in the figures for the percentage funded.
